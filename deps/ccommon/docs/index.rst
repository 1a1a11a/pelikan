   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Cache Common Docs

You have docs! You can delete this text in the `index.rst` file after
you:

1. Add your project documentation here. Add .md or .rst files to
   this directory and add their names (sans extension) to the toctree
   directive above. Feel free to reorder the file names above.

2. Edit the `about.rst` and describe your project.

3. (Optionally) Edit `conf.py` in this directory to fill in
   configuration details about your project like the author names, project name, version
   number, and so on.

At any time you can run ::

  $ doc.pex build -o /path/to/docs

to build your documentation site and open it in a browser.
