    <p>
      Pelikan is a cache framework written in C. It provides an expanding
      collection of cache services, and a common library used to build them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pelikan optimizes for high-throughput, low-latency data access in a
      datacenter-like environment. It adopts a highly modularized architecture,
      and is carefully implemented to achieve high-performance and reliability
      at scale. Its design captures much of the commonality among similar
      systems, such as Memcached, Redis and Twemproxy, and makes improving and
      iterating on such services easier and faster.
